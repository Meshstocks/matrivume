* Here's the whole story
(Be sure to write what inspired you, what you learned, how you built, and challenges you faced.)


## Inspiration
I grew up in a densely populated country. You always find someone to talk so there people talk a lot. They simply can't stop talking if they find a topic in social media they don't care if it's morally right or wrong. This has become a good platform for various fundamental groups to spread heat. And at the end, some small community will be the victim for this heats. This logic is my inspiration.
 
## What it does
It will use artificial intelligence to scale up and reduce domestic violence and protect human rights.
 
## How I built it
Mainly it is a mobile and web application back my database and powered by artificial intelligence.
 
## Challenges I ran into
I think the bigger challenge is this king of application unable to make a huge king of entrepreneurial money so is difficult to find funds.
 
## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
If computer science start solving this kind of problem. I will be proud to be a living human in this era. 
 
## What I learned
I learned how we work collaboratively. Humans can perform like an organism. 
 
## What's next for Martivume
We will work for preserving nature. It will help people to live an earth engaging life.
